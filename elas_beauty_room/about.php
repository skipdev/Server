									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									
									<p>My name is Ela Pawelczyk. I was born in Poland and came to England 10 years ago.
									I have always wanted to start my own beauty business, it's been my passion for many years.
									In Poland, it's hard to start your own business. Moving to England allowed me to have a three month trial of my business, and also meant that I didn't have to pay so much upfront.
									I love the lifestyle in England and speak English fluently. I was really struggling in Poland, whereas in England, my dreams are coming true!</p>
									
									<br>

									<h3>Why Beauty?</h3>
									<p>I've always been into makeup. I'd start almost every day by watching Youtube tutorials on nails and makeup; I was addicted!
									Watching these videos gave me the inspiration to start taking courses and start trying it out for myself. It started out as a hobby, doing my friend's nails and makeup for them, but soon this turned into a small business, which I love! 
									I'm currently running this business part-time, but would love to make it my full time job. I never would have expected this hobby to bring me money, but now that realised I can, it would be a dream come true.
									I run the studio in my own home, which allows me to always be there for my two little girls, while at the same time, doing something I love! As well as this, the fact that it's at my home makes the atmosphere very cosy and comfortable. Your time here will leave you relaxed and refreshed.</p>
